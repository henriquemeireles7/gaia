# Changelog

All notable changes to Gaia. Format adapted from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); semver per [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The repo is pre-1.0. Breaking changes happen freely until v1.0.0.

## Unreleased

### Added

- ast-grep replaces the broken Biome GritQL plugin path. 4 active rules in `tools/ast-grep/rules/`.
- `packages/security/{protected-route,public-route,security-headers,audit-log}.ts` — vision §Backend-5 middleware.
- `packages/ui/tokens.ts` + generated `styles.css` — three-tier design tokens (vision §Stack, tokens.md).
- Moon orchestration scaffolding (`.moon/workspace.yml`, per-project `moon.yml`).
- ADR directory at `.gaia/adrs/` with template + first decision (`0001-ast-grep-over-gritql.md`).

### Changed

- Removed Biome (`linter` + `formatter` were already disabled; the package now serves no role).
- knip flipped from advisory to a real CI gate.
- Five script-tier rules now active (`check-manifest`, `check-skills`, `validate-artifacts`, `check-tests-exist`).

### Removed

- `tools/gritql/` — the Biome GritQL drafts didn't fire in 2.4.x; replaced by `tools/ast-grep/rules/`.

## 0.1.0 — bootstrap (2026-04)

Initial commit set: kaz-setup template migrated onto the Gaia v6 stack across phases 1–8. See PR history on GitHub.
